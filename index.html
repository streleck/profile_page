        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Mark, a full stack developer based in Austin, TX. </p>
        <p>From a young age I have had a deep curiosity and desire to understand the world. I love to think. I love to analyze things. It was natural, then, that I would end up studying physics in college.</p>
        <p>While in school, I began tutoring high school students and discovered my passion for teaching, which I followed into special education.</p>
        <p>I have spent the bulk of my professional career at Texas School for the Blind & VI, working in the residential department. There I worked with a wide variety of students, focusing mostly on living skills. I was drawn the intellectual challenge of breaking down and communicating ideas, but mostly I loved the human connections I made there.</p>
        <p>In the back of my mind, however, was the desire to do something more analytical. I have always been excited by technology and the possibilities it creates. I decided to start learning coding and I was quickly hooked. I enrolled at a Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin and was greatly challenged and greatly fulfilled. I can't wait to start my new professional life!
