# My Profile Page
This is a page made to introduce me and my work to professional contacts.  It is made using basic HTML/CSS and a little bit of functionality with JQuery. The user can navigate through several different modals using a set of navigation buttons. In the 'Portfolio' section, the screenshot images serve as links to deployed sites.
